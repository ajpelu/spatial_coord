# spatial_coord

This repo contains a small app to draw diferent types of spatial objects and get their representation using the simple feature standard [ISO 19125-1:2004](https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html). 

Users can draw different spatial objetc (points, multipoints, lines, polygons, multipolygons) and get their human-readable **well-known text** [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) representation. 

## Sources 
We used different open sources to generate the app:

- Leaflet providers ...
